HIGH-LEVEL SUMMARY
We aimed to create a kids friendly activity center in order to help the young ones learn about eclipses. We want them to get in an engaging and interactive manner the scientific explanations for this natural phenomenon. We chose this project because children nowdays are more curious than ever, but not always they get the information they seek.

PROJECT DETAILS

The project consists of a website intended for kids between 5-12 years.

The main page has a top bar menu with home (the logo) and 3 buttons:

Eclipse Simulator: It opens a simulation of the eclipses' mechanism;

Solar Eclipse: It presents an animation which explains the phenomenon & then shows 4 animaions for each type of solar eclipse;

Lunar Eclipse: It presents an animation which explains the phenomenon & then shows 3 animaions for each type of lunar eclipse;

On the home page there are 7 activity options:

Understanding Eclipses: It presents 2 animated videos which present the 2 main types of eclipses;

Solar vs Lunar Eclipse: There are 2 buttons that go to the "Solar Elipses"/"Lunar Eclipses" tabs from the top menu;

Eclipsed Visions: There is a informative page where it is explained why an eclipse is visible only from a certain region at a given time;

Eclipses Prediction & Seasonal Patterns: There is a informative page where it is explained how are eclipses predicted & what are the seasonal patterns;

It's drawing time... Let's paint: Here it is a canvas with a small color palette where children can colour a given picture;

Quiz just for you: A quiz with shuffled 10 questions where children can test their knowledge;

Eclipse Live: It opens an integrated YouTube live video where everyone can watch a real eclipse at a given moment.


There is also a friendly AI-based chat bot, that can instantly answer the children's questions anytime.



The main benefit of this project is that children can learn in a fun way about eclipses, receiving also scientifically accurate answers. As a use case, it can be used as well as an individual user, but it can be also integrated in schools in order to teach kids.



Regarding the software part, our project presents in the form of a static website, exclusively based on frontend, which is build using the Anguar Framework.

USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

Yes, we used an AI-based chat bot for quick questions. It is based on the DialogFlow API
